A few hours grace before the madness begins again.
Buy the negatives at any price.
A tall, dark stranger will have more fun than you.
A visit to a strange place will bring fresh work.
A vivid and creative mind characterizes you.
All the troubles you have will pass away very quickly.
Are you a turtle?
Are you sure the back door is locked?
Beware the one behind you.
Everything that you know is wrong, but you can be straightened out.
